    Health Monitoring SystemHealth Monitoring System
   <br> Led the development of a cutting-edge Health Monitoring</br> 
   <br>System designed to enhance the safety and well-being of hill </br>
   <br> climbers in challenging terrains. Conducted thorough research into </br>
   <br> the health risks associated with hill climbing, including variations in </br>
   <br> body temperature, heart rate, and ECG readings. Designed and implemented a real-time</br>
   <br>  monitoring system integrated with user-friendly sensors for continuous vital </br>
   <br>  sign tracking. Developed a web interface for data storage, visualization, and trend </br>
   <br>  analysis using ThingSpeak integration. Ensured adherence to essential design principles, </br>
   <br>  including dependability, user-friendliness, data security, and scalability to provide climbers</br>
   <br>   with a reliable and intuitive solution for informed decision-making in extreme conditions.</p>
